# ExtraPy
Python3 package to analyse and handle electrophyiological extracellular recordings

The expected modules are:

1) Behaviour
    - load lick and param files
    - plot scatter plots
    - PSTH of lick
    - analyze training with different delays (extract the delay of each trial and then extract the licks of each trial and sort them by the delay)
    
2) Electrophysiology
    - Handle files
    - Phase-locking (by Lilian Goepp)

3) Filters
    - various filters (thanks to Sam Garcia for the original function)
    
4) Scalogram and time frequency analyses (by Sam Garcia)
