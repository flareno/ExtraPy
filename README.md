# ExtraPy
Python3 package to analyse and handle electrophyiological extracellular recordings

For the moment there is only the filters.py
The base of this script was the filter_signal function created by Sam Garcia, I have adapted this function also to a Notch filter.

The expected modules are:

- Filters
- Convert and cut HDF5
- Spike Sorting (TDC)
- Phase-locking
